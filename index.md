title: Introduction - Active Directory Design
---

# Introduction
The purpose of this design is to describe how to implement an Active Directory forest/domain with role-based access control (RBAC) as its core principal.

The management of resource or administrative access has been an ongoing challenge for many organisations; as the infrastructure grows undocumented changes are introduced leading to sensative personal data being exposed or service distruption due to those changes being a damage to the infrastructures eco system.

Used correctly RBAC provides a means of securing access to the needs of the business. This is aided by implementing a well formed organisational unit (OU) structure and good group policy (GPO) design that allows RBAC to be at its most effective. The result is greater IT operational efficiency, business agility, and improved security through a set of preventative controls.
